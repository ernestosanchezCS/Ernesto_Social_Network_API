# Social Network API Using Mongo DB

[![Licence : MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/Licence-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licences/MIT)

## Description

MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. The idea here was to increase my understanding with technologies that social networking platforms use in their full-stack applications. Because the foundation of these applications is data, it’s important that I understand how to build and structure the API first.
This repository application functions as API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. This back end app uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.
